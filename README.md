# Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey: Data Analysis

Here you can find the data for the project. [Where data came from](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/).

In this project I analysed Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey. I will be answering five questions which are as follows.

- At what companies do developers get the paid the most?
- How much does remote working matter to employees?
- How does coding experience affect the level of pay?
- What's the most popular method of learning to code?
- Are you more likely to get a job as a developer if you have a master's degree?
